Starter code
To start, make sure you've forked and cloned the constellations server, linked below. Follow the instructions in that repository to get the project up and running.

GitHub: Constellations server
Project setup
The src/main.js file includes an axios variable and a BASE_URL variable which points to the correct URL for the constellations server. Please do not change either of these lines.

All of the functions you will need to fill in are included in this file.

Functions
For each of the following functions, you will need to make a request using the BASE_URL. For each function, you should make a request using the BASE_URL and the provided path. Replace :id in any path with the appropriate parameter.

For example, your URL might look like the following:

const url = `${BASE_URL}/constellations/${id}`;
Remember that the response from axios will include a data key that will contain the response.

Once the request has been made, log out the data key as instructed below.
